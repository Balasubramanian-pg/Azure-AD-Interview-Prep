# Topic: Sites

## One-line definition
Sites are web locations with related content.

## Why this matters in interviews
Sites appear in web development and management systems, and interviewers care about understanding site structure and organization for efficient development and maintenance.

## Core concepts (max 3)
* **Concept 1:** A site is a collection of related web pages.
* **Concept 2:** Sites can be static or dynamic, depending on content updates.
* **Concept 3:** Site architecture affects user experience and search engine optimization.

## Key constraints and invariants
* Constraint 1: Sites must have a unique domain or subdomain.
* Constraint 2: Sites must follow web standards for compatibility.
* Constraint 3: Sites must ensure user data security and privacy.

## Common interview questions
* Explain sites in simple terms
* Compare sites with web applications
* Given scenario X, how would you apply site architecture principles?

## Tradeoffs and alternatives
* **Pros:** Easy to maintain, scalable, and cost-effective.
* **Cons:** Limited functionality, may require additional tools.
* **When to use instead:** Use a web application when complex interactions are required.

## One worked example
* Input: User requests a website with a homepage, about page, and contact page.
* Transformation / Logic: Create a site with a simple navigation menu and basic content.
* Output: A functional website with related content.

## Failure modes and debugging hints
* Failure mode 1: Poor site architecture, causing navigation issues.
* Failure mode 2: Inconsistent content updates, leading to outdated information.
* Failure mode 3: Insufficient security measures, resulting in data breaches.

## One-minute interview answer
A site is a web location with related content, and it's essential to use sites when you need a simple online presence. However, sites have limited functionality, so when complex interactions are required, a web application might be a better choice.

## Active practice (do immediately)
* **Task 1:** Create a simple site map for a personal website.
* **Task 2:** Answer the question: "What are the key differences between a site and a web application?" out loud without notes.

## Cheat sheet (TL;DR)
* Key definition: A site is a collection of related web pages.
* Core rule: Sites must follow web standards.
* Common pitfall: Poor site architecture.
* Typical use case: Personal or small business websites.
* One comparison point: Sites vs. web applications.
* One quick example: A blog is a type of site.
