# Topic: Sites

## One-line definition
A site is a location with specific resources and services.

## Why this matters in interviews
Sites appear in web development, networking, and infrastructure planning. Interviewers care about sites because they impact system scalability, security, and user experience.

## Core concepts (max 3)
* **Concept 1:** A site can be a physical or virtual location hosting resources.
* **Concept 2:** Sites can have varying levels of autonomy and connectivity.
* **Concept 3:** Site configuration affects system performance and reliability.

## Key constraints and invariants
* Constraint 1: Site resources must be accessible and secure.
* Constraint 2: Site configuration must adhere to organizational policies.
* Constraint 3: Site operations must be monitored and maintained.

## Common interview questions
* Explain site architecture in simple terms
* Compare site-based vs. cloud-based infrastructure
* Given scenario X, how would you optimize site performance?

## Tradeoffs and alternatives
* **Pros:** Improved resource utilization, enhanced security, and better scalability.
* **Cons:** Increased complexity, higher costs, and potential single points of failure.
* **When to use instead:** Use cloud-based infrastructure when site-based infrastructure is not feasible or cost-effective.

## One worked example
* Input: A company with multiple offices requiring localized resources and services.
* Transformation / Logic: Implement a site-based architecture with centralized management and monitoring.
* Output: Improved resource utilization, enhanced security, and better scalability.
* Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of sites.
* Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of sites.

## Failure modes and debugging hints
* Failure mode 1: Insufficient resource allocation, causing site downtime.
* Failure mode 2: Inadequate security measures, leading to site breaches.
* Failure mode 3: Poor site configuration, resulting in performance issues.

## One-minute interview answer
A site is a location with specific resources and services, and it's essential to consider site architecture when designing systems. When to use site-based infrastructure depends on the organization's needs and constraints. However, one tradeoff to consider is the increased complexity and potential single points of failure.

## Active practice (do immediately)
* **Task 1:** Design a simple site architecture for a company with two offices.
* **Task 2:** Answer the following question out loud without notes: "How would you optimize site performance in a resource-constrained environment?"

## Cheat sheet (TL;DR)
* Key definition: A site is a location with specific resources and services.
* Core rule: Site configuration affects system performance and reliability.
* Common pitfall: Insufficient resource allocation.
* Typical use case: Implementing a site-based architecture for a company with multiple offices.
* One comparison point: Site-based vs. cloud-based infrastructure.
* One quick example: A company with two offices requiring localized resources and services.
