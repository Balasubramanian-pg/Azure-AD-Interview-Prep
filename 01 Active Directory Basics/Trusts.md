# Topic: Trusts

## One-line definition
A trust is a legal entity holding assets for beneficiaries.

## Why this matters in interviews
Trusts appear in estate planning, tax law, and financial systems, and interviewers care about understanding their structure and applications to assess a candidate's knowledge of legal and financial concepts.

## Core concepts (max 3)
* **Grantor:** The person creating the trust, also known as the settlor.
* **Trustee:** The person or entity managing the trust assets.
* **Beneficiary:** The person or entity receiving the trust benefits.

## Key constraints and invariants
* The trust must have a clear purpose.
* The trustee has a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries.
* The trust assets must be separate from the trustee's personal assets.

## Common interview questions
* Explain the difference between a revocable and irrevocable trust.
* Compare trusts with wills as estate planning tools.
* Given a scenario where a person wants to leave assets to their minor children, how would you apply a trust?

## Tradeoffs and alternatives
* **Pros:** Trusts provide tax benefits, asset protection, and flexibility in distributing assets.
* **Cons:** Trusts can be complex and costly to establish and maintain.
* **When to use instead:** Consider using a will or other estate planning tools when the estate is simple and the assets are minimal.

## One worked example
* Input: A grantor creates a trust with $100,000 for their two children.
* Transformation / Logic: The trustee manages the assets and distributes them to the beneficiaries according to the trust terms.
* Output: The beneficiaries receive the trust assets, and the grantor may receive tax benefits.

## Failure modes and debugging hints
* Failure mode 1: The trust is not properly funded, and the assets are not transferred to the trust.
* Failure mode 2: The trustee fails to follow the trust terms, and the beneficiaries do not receive the intended benefits.
* Failure mode 3: The trust is not updated to reflect changes in the grantor's circumstances or tax laws.

## One-minute interview answer
A trust is a legal entity that holds assets for beneficiaries, and it's commonly used in estate planning to provide tax benefits and flexibility in distributing assets. However, trusts can be complex and costly to establish and maintain, so it's essential to weigh the pros and cons and consider alternative estate planning tools.

## Active practice (do immediately)
* **Task 1:** Create a simple trust diagram showing the grantor, trustee, and beneficiaries.
* **Task 2:** Answer the following question out loud without notes: "What is the main difference between a revocable and irrevocable trust?"

## Cheat sheet (TL;DR)
* Key definition: A trust is a legal entity holding assets for beneficiaries.
* Core rule: The trustee has a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries.
* Common pitfall: Failing to properly fund the trust.
* Typical use case: Estate planning for individuals with minor children or complex assets.
* One comparison point: Trusts vs. wills.
* One quick example: A grantor creates a trust to provide for their pet after they pass away.
