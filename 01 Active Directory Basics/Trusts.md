# Topic: Trusts

## One-line definition
Trusts are **legal entities holding assets**.

## Why this matters in interviews
Trusts appear in estate planning and tax systems, and interviewers care about understanding their structure and application to assess a candidate's knowledge of legal and financial concepts.

## Core concepts (max 3)
* **Concept 1:** A trust is a separate legal entity that holds assets for the benefit of beneficiaries.
* **Concept 2:** Trusts can be revocable or irrevocable, affecting their tax implications and control.
* **Concept 3:** Trusts require a trustee to manage and distribute assets according to the trust agreement.

## Key constraints and invariants
* The trustee must act in the best interest of the beneficiaries.
* The trust agreement must be legally binding and clear in its terms.
* The trust's assets must be separate from the trustee's personal assets.

## Common interview questions
* Explain trusts in simple terms
* Compare trusts with wills
* Given a scenario where a person wants to leave assets to their grandchildren, how would you apply trusts?

## Tradeoffs and alternatives
* **Pros:** Tax benefits, asset protection, and control over asset distribution.
* **Cons:** Complexity, cost, and potential for disputes among beneficiaries.
* **When to use instead:** Consider using a will or other estate planning tools when simplicity and low cost are prioritized.

## One worked example
* Input: A person creates a trust with $100,000 for their two children.
* Transformation / Logic: The trust is managed by a trustee, who distributes the assets according to the trust agreement.
* Output: The children receive the trust assets, potentially with tax benefits and protection from creditors.

## Failure modes and debugging hints
* Failure mode 1: Poorly drafted trust agreements can lead to disputes and legal issues; why it happens is due to lack of clarity or incomplete terms.
* Failure mode 2: Failure to fund the trust can render it ineffective; detection involves reviewing the trust's assets and ensuring they are properly transferred.
* Failure mode 3: Inadequate trustee selection can lead to mismanagement; a quick fix is to appoint a new, competent trustee.

## One-minute interview answer
Trusts are legal entities that hold assets for beneficiaries, offering control and tax benefits. They are useful when individuals want to manage asset distribution and protect their assets. However, trusts can be complex and costly, so it's essential to weigh these tradeoffs when considering their use.
