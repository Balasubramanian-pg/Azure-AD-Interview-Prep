# Topic: Domain

## One-line definition
Domain is a unique internet address identifier.

## Why this matters in interviews
Domain management appears in web development and system administration, and interviewers care about it because it affects website accessibility and security.

## Core concepts (max 3)
* **Concept 1:** A domain is a unique string of characters used to identify a website or online resource.
* **Concept 2:** Domain names are typically composed of a top-level domain (TLD) and a second-level domain (SLD).
* **Concept 3:** Domain registration involves purchasing a domain name from a registrar for a specified period.

## Key constraints and invariants
* Domain names must be unique and follow a specific syntax.
* Domain registration requires accurate contact information and payment.
* Domain names must be renewed periodically to maintain ownership.

## Common interview questions
* Explain domain name system (DNS) in simple terms
* Compare domain registration with web hosting
* Given a scenario where a company wants to change its domain name, how would you apply the necessary updates?

## Tradeoffs and alternatives
* **Pros:** Easy to remember, improves website credibility, and enhances brand identity.
* **Cons:** Requires periodic renewal, may be subject to cybersquatters, and can be expensive.
* **When to use instead:** Consider using subdomains or alternative top-level domains (TLDs) when the desired domain name is not available.

## One worked example
* Input: A company wants to register the domain name "example.com".
* Transformation / Logic: The company searches for the availability of the domain name, provides required contact information, and completes the payment process.
* Output: The company successfully registers the domain name "example.com" for a specified period.

## Failure modes and debugging hints
* Failure mode 1: Domain name typos or incorrect syntax, which can be resolved by double-checking the domain name.
* Failure mode 2: Domain name unavailability, which can be detected by searching for alternative domain names or TLDs.
* Failure mode 3: Domain registration expiration, which can be quickly fixed by renewing the domain name before the expiration date.

## One-minute interview answer
Domain refers to a unique internet address identifier that improves website credibility and enhances brand identity. It's essential to use a domain when creating a professional website or online presence. However, one tradeoff to consider is the potential expense and need for periodic renewal, which can be mitigated by choosing alternative TLDs or subdomains.
