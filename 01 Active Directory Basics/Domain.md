# Topic: Domain

## One-line definition
A domain is a unique identifier for a website or network.

## Why this matters in interviews
Domains appear in web development, networking, and cybersecurity systems. Interviewers care about domains because they are crucial for online identity, security, and accessibility.

## Core concepts (max 3)
* **Concept 1:** A domain is a human-readable string of characters that identifies a website or network.
* **Concept 2:** Domain names are managed through the Domain Name System (DNS), which translates domain names to IP addresses.
* **Concept 3:** Domains can be registered and owned by individuals or organizations, and can have various top-level domains (TLDs) such as .com or .org.

## Key constraints and invariants
* Domain names must be unique and follow a specific syntax.
* Domain names must be registered with a domain registrar.
* Domain names must be resolved to an IP address through DNS.

## Common interview questions
* Explain the concept of a domain in simple terms
* Compare a domain with an IP address
* Given a scenario where a company wants to launch a new website, how would you recommend choosing a domain name?

## Tradeoffs and alternatives
* **Pros:** Easy to remember, improves brand recognition, and provides a professional image.
* **Cons:** Requires registration and maintenance, can be expensive, and may have limited availability.
* **When to use instead:** Use an IP address or a subdomain when a domain name is not available or not necessary.

## One worked example
* Input: A user types a domain name into a web browser.
* Transformation / Logic: The domain name is resolved to an IP address through DNS, and the website is loaded from the corresponding server.
* Output: The website is displayed in the user's web browser.
* Time complexity: O(1) (constant time) for DNS lookup.
* Space complexity: O(1) (constant space) for storing the domain name and IP address.

## Failure modes and debugging hints
* Failure mode 1: Domain name not registered or expired, resulting in a "domain not found" error.
* Failure mode 2: DNS resolution failure, resulting in a "server not found" error.
* Failure mode 3: Website not configured correctly, resulting in a "404 not found" error.

## One-minute interview answer
A domain is a unique identifier for a website or network, and it's essential for online presence and accessibility. When choosing a domain name, consider factors such as brand recognition, memorability, and availability. However, domains require registration and maintenance, and may have limited availability, so it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.

## Active practice (do immediately)
* **Task 1:** Explain the difference between a domain name and an IP address to a non-technical friend.
* **Task 2:** Answer the question "What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a subdomain instead of a separate domain name?" out loud without notes.

## Cheat sheet (TL;DR)
* Key definition: A domain is a unique identifier for a website or network.
* Core rule: Domain names must be unique and follow a specific syntax.
* Common pitfall: Forgetting to register or renew a domain name.
* Typical use case: Launching a new website or online service.
* One comparison point: Domains vs. IP addresses.
* One quick example or formula: example.com (domain name) vs. 192.0.2.1 (IP address).

## Sources and verification
* Source name or URL: ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) - [www.icann.org](http://www.icann.org)
* Mark anything time-sensitive as **NEEDS VERIFICATION**: Domain name registration and expiration dates.

## Self-test
* **Conceptual:** Why is it important to choose a unique and memorable domain name for a website?
* **Applied:** How would you configure DNS records for a new domain name to point to a web server?
